Analyzing customer shopping patterns for a demo store including customer segmentation, product performance, and sales/marketing insights using PostgreSQL.

## Summary of project steps

- Sourced data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset?select=shopping_trends_updated.csv).
- Download and set up PostgreSQL environment.
- Create a table in SQL Shell (psql) under the existing database.
- Answer relevant questions concerning shopping trends and derive insights.

## Important Notes

- Data was synthetically generated and does not reflect real-world data. This is because there isn't much variance in data results (for example, male vs. female trends are almost identical, which isn't consistent with actual customer behavior). Despite this, the insights can be as impactful when applied to real-world data.
